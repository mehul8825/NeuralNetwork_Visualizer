## Introduction
This project demonstrates the application of neural networks in solving a machine learning problem. The goal is to explore the capabilities of neural networks and evaluate their performance on the given dataset.
for this project I've used **flask** for the deploying and testing the Neural Network. Also it trained on our custom dataset.
## Features
- Implementation of a neural network from scratch or using a framework (e.g. PyTorch).
- Training and evaluation on a dataset.
- Visualization of results and performance metrics.
